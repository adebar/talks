[![Video Banner](banner.jpg)](https://www.meetup.com/Full-Stack-Quants/events/248899125/)

On Monday July 9th, 2018 I will give a presentation about Vega at at [Full Stack Quants](http://fullstackquants.org/) London. Vega is a framework for interactive visualisation. The talk will include a step-by-step tutorial for creating production-quality visualisations. Finally, I will give an overview of related libraries and tools that you can use to create plots more easily.

The talk does not require extensive knowledge of Javascript or Python. It aims to provide useful information for beginners as well as people who are already  familiar with these visualisation frameworks.

**If you want to attend the talk, please sign up on [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/Full-Stack-Quants/events/248899125/).
